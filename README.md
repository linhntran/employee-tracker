# Employee Tracker

## Description

This week's challenge allows us to utilize our skills to create a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

The following walkthrough video demonstrates the functionality of the Employee Tracker. The video shows how a user would invoke the application from the command line and how they would navigate through the application.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local environment and open in any source code editor (VS Code for example). 

The user will need to have Node.js installed. Follow the instructions outlined in the [Node Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

To install inquier, please use `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in the command line. The application can then be initialized using the `node index.js` command. 

The MySQL2 package is also needed to perform queries. To install, please use `npm install --save mysql2` in the command line. To learn more about this follow the link to [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2).

To print the MySQL rows to the console, please use the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) which can be installed using `npm install console.table --save` in the command line.

## Usage

Once all technologies listed in the Installation section above have been installed, simply invoke the application by using the `node index.js` command to launch the Employee Tracker application.
